      <description>ECON1: Principles of Microeconomics, Fall 2021Each week of the ten week quarter I held an discussion section reviewing course content and helping students perform practice problems. I also held office hours, helped create exam questions and helped ensure lectures ran smoothly by answering questions in the lecture hall and on discord.

  My name is Vincent Armentano and I am currently a PhD student 
  at the Department of Economics at UC San Diego.
  I hold a BA in Economics from Northeastern University. 
  My main interests lie in development economics and applied microeconomics with a special focus on agricultural production. 
  Currently I am working on projects concerning smallholder farmers' expectations of rainfall and risk averse behavior as well
  as examining potential labor misallocation and tenuous property rights.

excerpt: Submitted October 2022.
#We report on a large-scale urban resettlement program in Uruguay. Over the course of seven years the program randomly assigned thousands of low-income households  to ownership of apartments in new buildings in middle-class areas, including a subsidy averaging $44,000 per household. We match applicants to comprehensive administrative data on employment, schooling, health, fertility, and voting over the decade subsequent to the move. We find that the program led to a small decline in fertility for women and a two percentage point increase in formal employment, but did not drive school attendance. Likely due to the lack of strong spatial inequality in Uruguay, this relocation program did not result in transformative improvements in the lives of its beneficiaries.

The brightest star in this photo, midway up on the left side, is Alpha Centauri. This is the closest star system to us and the third brightest star (even though it's actually a system of three) in the sky after Sirius and Canopus. In this photo it's just upstream, to the left, of the Southern Cross. This was a treat to see as it can't be seen in the Northern Hemisphere at all.
